function transmitTime=transTimeTable(activeChnList,trackResults...
    ,subFrameStart,TOW,settings)
%transTimeTable establishes a transmitting time table for all satellites on
%track. TOW is the transmiting time at the start of the subframe for all
%satellites, based on that the time table can be established.
%transmitTime=transTimeTable(activeChnList,trackResults...
%    ,subFrameStart,TOW,settings)
%
%   Inputs:
%       activeChnList - a list of active satellites
%       trackResults  - output from the tracking function
%       subFrameStart - the start of first detected subframe
%       TOW           - transmitting time of satellites at the first
%                       detected subframe
%       settings      - receiver settings
%
%   Outputs:
%       transmitTime  - Transmitting time table for all active satellites
